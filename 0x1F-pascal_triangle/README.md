This interview algorithm project uses a list of lists of integers to represent Pascal's triangle

Pascal's Triangle

Write a function in Python def pascal_triangle(n) that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of n:
returns an empty list if n <= 0
n will always be an integer
test_files
The test_files directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally.
